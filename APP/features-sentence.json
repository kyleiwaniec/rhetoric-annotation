Second most important elements are placed at the start, and least important are placed in the middle. Opening emphasis is indicated by the practice of fronting certain words, phrases, or clauses that would otherwise receive less emphasis buried in the sentence: I will eventually receive my diploma versus Eventually, I will receive my diploma. \nBy sentence role: (pg. 206): The main constituents of a sentence, the subject, verb, and object, receive more emphasis than secondary sentence elements, all the words, phrases, and clauses that perform adverbial and adjectival functions. Subjects receive this greater attention even when they are not the first item in a sentence. \nFrom inversions (pg. 207): The natural positions of emphasis described above follow the standard sentence floor plans in English: Subject – Verb – Object or Subject – Linking Verb – Complement. Small variations in word order can shift emphasis and subtly change meaning (anastrophy, hyperbaton). Singleword adjectives can be placed after a noun: the tall cedars → the cedars tall; the crooked and homely man → the man, crooked and homely. Positioned after their nouns, these adjectives receive considerably more emphasis. Subtle differences can also result from more idiomatic displacements, as in the difference between the last man in line versus the man last in line; the second version carries the sense of a more adventitious circumstance. Switching a subject with a predicate adjective, however, produces emphasis by unexpected positioning: The night was clear and starry → Clear and starry was the night. Adverbial modifiers can easily be moved to the front of the sentence and the relative positions of the subject and verb switched: The sound of snoring came from the back of the room → From the back of the room came the sound of snoring. A switch like this is typically made to put the subject in the position of greater emphasis at the end.",
