  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'So interesting!' does not contain future tense. It is an exclamation expressing the speaker's immediate reaction to something, rather than indicating something that will happen in the future. Future tense typically involves the use of auxiliary verbs like 'will' or 'shall' combined with the base form of the main verb, which is not present in the given sentence.""
