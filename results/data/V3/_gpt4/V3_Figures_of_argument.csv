  ""Answer"": ""yes"",
  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.' contains antithesis. It presents two opposing groups or ideas: on one side, BDS, Hamas, blood libels, and those who want to destroy Israel; and on the other side, Jews. The contrast is between standing with a group associated with negative actions towards Israel and Jews, and standing with Jews themselves. The structure of the sentence is parallel, enhancing the contrast between the two opposing sides, which is a characteristic feature of antithesis.""

  ""Answer"": ""no"",
  ""Explanation"": ""Antimetabole is a rhetorical device that involves repeating a phrase in reverse order. The classic structure of antimetabole is AB-BA, where the first half of a sentence or phrase (AB) is flipped in the second half (BA). The sentence provided ('Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.') does not contain a repetition of words or phrases in reverse order. It presents a contrast and a choice but does not reverse the structure of the phrases. Therefore, it does not demonstrate antimetabole.""
