A 'definite/hypothesis' field would involve language that references specific people or things, often in a context that suggests a concrete scenario or a speculative situation. The sentence provided does not contain a lexical or semantic field that could be characterized as 'definite/hypothesis.' It makes a general statement about the attitudes of 'growing numbers of Catholics' without referencing a specific situation or proposing a hypothetical scenario. It does not ask a question or propose a condition that would require a hypothesis. Instead, it presents an observation about a change in moral attitudes within a group.""

'Photograph' implies a visual image, 'spacecraft' is a tangible object, and 'miles' is a unit of distance measurement. These terms are associated with concrete concepts as opposed to abstract ones.""

  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'NASA has released a record-breaking photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft when it was 3.79 billion miles away from the Earth' does not contain a lexical or semantic field that could be characterized as indefinite/thesis. The sentence is quite specific, mentioning a particular agency (NASA), a specific action (released a record-breaking photograph), and a particular subject (the New Horizons spacecraft) at a defined distance from Earth. It refers to a specific event and does not leave elements like persons, time, or place indefinite.

  ""Explanation"": ""In the context of lexical and semantic fields, a 'definite/hypothesis' field would involve language that references specific people or things with a sense of conjecture or speculation. The sentence provided ('NASA has released a record-breaking photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft when it was 3.79 billion miles away from the Earth.') does not contain a hypothesis or speculative language. Instead, it presents a factual statement about an event that has occurred, namely the release of a photograph by NASA. There is no conjecture or speculation about a future or hypothetical event, person, or thing, which would be necessary to characterize the field as 'definite/hypothesis'.""
