  ""Explanation"": ""Doubling refers to the repetition of similar or identical words to emphasize a point or create new meaning, often seen in terms like 'goody-goody' or 'riff-raff'. In the provided sentence, there is no repetition of similar or identical words that would constitute doubling. The sentence does repeat the word 'former' to describe both CIA Director Brennan and Director of National Intelligence Clapper, but this does not create a new meaning or emphasize the point in the way doubling typically does.

  ""Answer"": ""no"",
  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence provided does not utilize blends. Blends are words formed by combining parts of two or more words to create a new word, often by taking the beginning of one word and attaching it to the end of another. The examples given, 'televangelist' and 'shockumentary', are blends because they merge parts of two distinct words into a single new term. The sentence in question does not contain any new words that are formed by such a combination of parts from different words. All the words used in the sentence ('leftwing', 'witch hunt', 'ongoing', 'day one', 'presidency', 'impair', 'impede', 'ability', 'get the job done') are standard English words or phrases that have not been altered to create new blended terms.""

The example given, 'spam for unwanted email', is a case of catachresis because 'spam' originally referred to a canned meat product and was borrowed to label unsolicited emails. In the sentence provided, 'supportive' is used in a way that suggests irony or skepticism about the lawmakers' and lawyers' integrity. This is not catachresis but rather a rhetorical device, possibly sarcasm or verbal irony, where the word 'supportive' is used in a way that actually questions the supportiveness of the individuals in question. The word 'supportive' is not being used to fill a gap where no appropriate word exists; instead, it is being used with a twist to its conventional meaning to convey an opposite or nuanced sentiment.""
