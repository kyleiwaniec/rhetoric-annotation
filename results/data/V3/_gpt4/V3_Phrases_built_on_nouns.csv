Absolute constructions are often set off by a comma or pair of commas and provide additional information about the circumstances in a sentence. In the example provided, 'The driver, his hair invisible under his cap,' 'his hair invisible under his cap' is an absolute construction because it consists of a noun ('hair') and a participle ('invisible') that provides additional information about 'The driver.' However, in the sentence 'This is a very real threat – one that is largely immune to attack from the air,' there is no such construction. The phrase 'one that is largely immune to attack from the air' is a relative clause modifying 'threat' and does not form an absolute construction because it does not contain a noun plus participle that stands apart from the sentence as additional information.

  ""Explanation"": ""An absolute construction is a grammatical phrase that modifies an entire sentence, not just a noun, and is often a noun phrase followed by a participle or a participial phrase that has a subject of its own, but no connecting verb. In the sentence provided, there is no phrase that fits this description. The phrase 'screaming through my door' is a participle phrase describing the action of the woman, and it is directly related to the verb 'was' (implied in parentheses), which makes it not an absolute construction. Absolute constructions are non-finite clauses that are loosely connected to the sentence without a conjunction or other explicit means, and they do not share their subject with the main clause. An example of an absolute construction would be 'Her arms folded across her chest, she walked out of the room.' In the given sentence, all phrases are directly connected to the main clause and its subject without the distinct characteristics of an absolute construction.""

  ""Explanation"": ""In the provided sentence, there is no noun phrase that summarizes or generalizes a preceding clause or phrase. A summative modifier is typically a noun phrase that follows a clause and serves to summarize its main point or encapsulate its meaning in a succinct way. The sentence 'Why not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?' does not contain a subsequent noun phrase that encapsulates the meaning of the preceding text. Instead, it is a rhetorical question followed by a clause providing a reason for the question.""

  ""Answer"": ""no"",
  ""Explanation"": ""In the provided sentence, there are no phrases built on nouns that act as summative modifiers. A summative modifier is a noun phrase that summarizes or encapsulates the idea of the preceding clause or phrase. The sentence discusses a set of regulations (ITAR) and an accusation against Wilson, but it does not contain a noun phrase that summarizes these actions or the situation. The closest element to a summative modifier might be 'an obscure set of US regulations known as the International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR),' but this is not summarizing a preceding clause or phrase; it is part of the main clause that provides additional information about ITAR.""
