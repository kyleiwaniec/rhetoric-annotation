  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'The Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.' utilizes stative voice. Stative voice is characterized by the description of a state or condition rather than an action. In this sentence, 'set' is a past tense verb that indicates a state that has been established, and 'cannot remain' expresses a state of being. There is no action being performed upon the subject, nor is there a mix of active and passive voice regarding a single subject, which would be necessary for a compound voice. Therefore, the sentence is best described as using stative voice.""

  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'It was a foolish mistake by a very young man,' as stated by Saucier's lawyer, Greg Rinckey, employs stative voice. Stative voice is used to describe a state or condition rather than an action. In this case, 'was' is a stative verb that describes the condition or state of being of 'a foolish mistake.'

However, the stative part of the sentence does not fit the provided definition of 'stative voice' because the subject 'it' is not receiving an action from someone else; rather, it describes a state of being.

Stative voice is used to describe a state or condition rather than an action. In this sentence, 'made attempts' is a past action, but the main clause 'it is now solidly mainstream in the worst sense' describes the current state of being mainstream, which is a condition or state, not an action. There is no use of passive voice in the sentence, and the active voice is only present in the subordinate clause 'it earlier made attempts.'

  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence in question does not utilize what is traditionally known as 'stative voice,' which is a misunderstanding of the term. In linguistic terms, 'stative' refers to verbs that describe a state of being or condition, such as 'know,' 'believe,' or 'love.' These verbs do not usually have a continuous form (ending in 'ing'), but they do not necessarily include the auxiliary 'be' nor imply that the subject is receiving an action. The sentence provided ('That be far from thee to do after this manner...') contains a mix of archaic language and modal constructions. The verb 'be' here is used in a subjunctive or imperative sense, not as a stative verb.

Stative voice is characterized by the use of stative verbs that describe a state of being or condition rather than an action. In this sentence, 'be far from thee' and 'do right' are stative constructions; they describe a state or quality (being far from an action, being just) rather than an action being performed by the subject.

  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence provided does not utilize a 'stative' voice as defined in the context provided. The sentence is complex and contains multiple clauses with different voices. The first part, 'For Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio’s resignation be unthinkable,' uses a passive construction ('would be unthinkable'), which could be mistaken for stative. However, the 'stative' voice as defined in the prompt is characterized by the subject receiving the action without the use of 'be' as a helping verb and without the main verb ending in 'ing.' In this case, 'be' is used as a helping verb, but it is part of a passive voice construction, not a stative voice. The second part of the sentence, 'so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled,' is also not stative. It describes an action ('have enabled') that has been performed by the subject ('Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen'), which is an active voice. Therefore, the sentence does not fit the definition of 'stative' voice provided in the prompt.""

  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence does not utilize a 'compound' voice as defined in the context of predication. The sentence is primarily in the active voice, as it describes actions that Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen are performing ('have systematically enabled'). There is no switch between active and passive voice regarding a single subject within the sentence. The concept of 'stative' voice is not standard in linguistic terminology, but stative verbs are those that describe a state of being or condition, and the sentence does include stative elements (e.g., 'would be unthinkable,' 'would a purge').
