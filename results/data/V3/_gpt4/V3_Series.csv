The sentence is a simple statement with a descriptive clause and does not have a series of items that would require conjunctions.""

  ""Explanation"": ""Bracketing in the context of a series involves grouping different items together in such a way that they are perceived as belonging to the same category. The sentence 'Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries.' lists actions that hospitals are taking in response to a situation, likely a crisis or resource shortage. These actions are related and fall under the same category of hospital responses or measures. Therefore, they are not being 'bracketed' with unrelated or implicitly different categories, but are instead a straightforward list of related actions. Bracketing would occur if the sentence grouped together entities or concepts that are not typically related or are only implicitly connected, suggesting a shared characteristic or category.""
