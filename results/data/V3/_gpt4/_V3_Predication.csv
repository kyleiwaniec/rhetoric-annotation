The example given, The telegram was late but contained exciting news, shows the telegram (subject) being described in passive voice (was late) and active voice (contained exciting news). In the sentence you provided, there is no clear instance where the subject is being described using both active and passive voice. The sentence maintains a consistent voice throughout, which is primarily active, as it describes actions and stances associated with the subject (who...scoffs at the notion and busies himself defending).', 'Property': 'compound'}]",['active']

}",['stative'],1,['stative'],1.0,0.0,,['active'],"[{'Answer': 'no', 'Explanation': 'The sentence provided does not contain active voice verbs. The verbs used (is coming, are going, are going to happen) are all in the passive voice or do not have a clear actor performing the action. In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action, but in this sentence, the subjects (something, they, a lot of different things) are not performing an action but are rather in a state of being or are acted upon.', 'Property': 'active'}, {'Answer': 'no', 'Explanation': 'The concept of stative voice as described does not exist in grammatical terminology. The sentence in question does not contain what is traditionally known as stative verbs. Stative verbs are verbs that describe a state of being or condition, such as know, believe, or love. They do not describe actions being done by or to the subject, and they do not typically use progressive tenses (-ing forms). In the sentence provided, is coming is a present continuous form of the verb come, which is an action verb, not a stative verb. Additionally, the sentence does not fit the description provided because the main verb coming ends in ing, which contradicts the statement that stative voice verbs will never end in ing. Therefore, the sentence does not contain stative voice as per the given definition.', 'Property': 'stative'}, {'Answer': 'no', 'Explanation': 'The concept of compound voice is not a standard term in English grammar. Typically, we discuss voice in terms of active or passive. A sentence in active voice has the subject performing the action, while in passive voice, the subject is acted upon. The example sentence provided does not combine active and passive voice regarding a single subject. Instead, it uses active voice throughout (something is coming up and down, they are either going to hit the ground, things are going to happen). Each clauses subject is performing the action, which is characteristic of active voice. Therefore, the sentence does not contain what youve referred to as compound voice.', 'Property': 'compound'}]",[]
