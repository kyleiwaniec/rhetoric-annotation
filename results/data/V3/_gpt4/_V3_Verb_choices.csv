Negation typically involves the use of words like not, no, never, none, and other negative contractions and prefixes to indicate the opposite or absence of something. In the sentence provided, the phrase could not only deprive him does suggest a potential negative outcome, but it is part of a larger construction that is conditional and speculative rather than purely negating an action or state.
