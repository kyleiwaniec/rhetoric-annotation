  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal' does not contain a lexical or semantic field that can be characterized as a prototype. A prototype involves using a specific member of a category to represent the entire category, such as using 'robin' to represent 'bird.' In this sentence, 'cardinal' refers to a specific role within the context of the Catholic Church, but it does not serve as a representative example of a broader category in the same way that 'robin' does for 'bird.' Therefore, it does not fit the definition of a prototype in lexical or semantic fields.""
