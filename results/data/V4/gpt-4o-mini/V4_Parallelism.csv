  ""Answer"": ""no"",
  ""Explanation"": ""The sentence 'It could but I don’t believe it would be, because power respects power' does not demonstrate parallelism in comparison. While it contains contrasting ideas, the structure of the phrases is not parallel. The first part ('It could but I don’t believe it would be') presents two different clauses that do not mirror each other in form or structure, and the second part ('because power respects power') does not create a parallel comparison with the first part. True parallelism would require similar grammatical structures in the compared elements.""
